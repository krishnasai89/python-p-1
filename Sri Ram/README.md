# 1.Turtle Graphics: 

The turtle module in Python allows you to create drawings and graphics using a virtual turtle that moves around the screen. It’s a fun way to introduce programming concepts to beginners.

# 2.Title and Background Color: 

You’ve set the title of your turtle graphics window to “Jai Shree Ram” (which means “Hail Lord Rama” in Hindi). And the background color is black, creating a dramatic backdrop for your artwork.

#3.Drawing the Circular Arrangement:

You’ve defined a list called Ram_name with a single element: "జై శ్రీరామ్."

The angle variable is calculated as 360 divided by 49 (since you have 50 elements in your list).

The turtle starts by lifting its pen (penup()), moving down slightly (sety(-1)), and then proceeds to draw the circular arrangement.

For each iteration, it turns left by the specified angle, moves forward by 260 units (presumably to the outer edge of the circle), writes the corresponding element from Ram_name, and then moves back to the center.

The font used for the text is Arial, bold, and size 12.

# 4.Color and Pen Size: 

The turtle’s pen color is orange, and the pen size is set to 6.
