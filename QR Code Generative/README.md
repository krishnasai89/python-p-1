# install qrcode

pip install qrcode


# 1.Importing the qrcode Module:

The line import qrcode brings in the qrcode module, which allows you to generate QR codes from any kind of data.

# 2.Generating the QR Code:

You’ve specified the data for your QR code: a URL pointing to your GitHub profile (https://github.com/vellampallikrishnasaigifhub).

The qrcode.make(data) function creates a QR code image based on the provided data.

The resulting QR code is stored in the qr variable.

# 3.Saving the QR Code Image:

The qr.save("github.png") line saves the QR code image as a PNG file named “github.png” in your current working directory.

Now you have a file containing your GitHub QR code!

# 4.Print Confirmation:

The last line prints a message to let you know that the QR code has been generated and saved successfully.
