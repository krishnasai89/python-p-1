1.User Guessing Game:

The first part of your code implements a simple guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

Here’s how it works:

The computer generates a random number between 1 and the specified upper limit (x).

The user repeatedly guesses numbers until they guess the correct one.

The program provides feedback (whether the guess is too high or too low) after each attempt.

Once the user guesses correctly, the game ends.

2.Computer Guessing Game:

The second part of your code reverses the roles: now the computer tries to guess a number that the user is thinking of.

The user provides feedback (too high, too low, or correct) after each computer guess.

The computer adjusts its guess range based on the feedback until it guesses correctly.

3.Overall Interaction:

The two games demonstrate different approaches to guessing numbers—one where the user guesses, and the other where the computer guesses.

It’s a fun way to explore conditional statements, loops, and user input handling.
