# Rock Paper Scissors

You’ve defined a function called play(). This function takes user input (either ‘r’ for rock, ‘p’ for paper, or ‘s’ for scissors) and generates a random choice for the computer.

If the user’s choice matches the computer’s choice, it’s a tie.

Otherwise, you have another function called is_win(player, opponent) that determines whether the player wins based on the rock-paper-scissors rules.

Now, let’s play it out! You chose… 🥁

drumroll

Rock!

And the computer chose… 🎲

Scissors!

Congratulations! You win this round! 🎉
