#gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech):

You can use it to generate spoken MP3 data, which you can then save to a file or manipulate further.
Some cool features of gTTS include customizable sentence tokenization (so it can handle long texts while maintaining proper intonation), as well as customizable text pre-processors (which can correct pronunciation, among other things).
To install gTTS, simply run:
pip install gTTS
