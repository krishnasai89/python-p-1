# install zxcvbn:

 pip install zxcvbn

 You can now use the zxcvbn() function to analyze the strength of a password. Pass the password as the first parameter, and optionally provide a list of user-provided inputs (such as names or other context) as the user_inputs parameter.

# install getpass:

 pip install getpass

 You can now use the getpass.getpass() function to securely read passwords without displaying them on the screen.

# 1.Importing the zxcvbn Module:

 The line from zxcvbn import zxcvbn brings in the zxcvbn module, which is a realistic password strength estimator.

 The original zxcvbn library was written in JavaScript by the team at Dropbox.

# 2.Checking Password Strength:

 The user is prompted to enter a password (securely, without echoing it on the screen).

 The zxcvbn() function analyzes the password and provides the following information:

 The password itself.

 A score (from 0 to 4) indicating its strength.

 An estimate of how long it would take to crack the password in different scenarios.

 Feedback and suggestions for improving the password.
