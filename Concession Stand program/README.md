- You have used a while loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to quit. This is a good approach.

- You have used the menu.get(food) method to retrieve the price of the selected item. This is a good way to avoid KeyError exceptions.

- You have used an if-elif statement to check if the user wants to quit or if the selected item is in the menu. This is a good way to handle different scenarios.
