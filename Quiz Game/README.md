# QUIZ GAME

Create a variable to keep track of the player’s score (let’s call it score).

Ask questions to the user using the input() function.

If the user gives a correct answer, increase the score by 1 and print “Correct!”

If the user’s answer is incorrect, print “Incorrect!” and provide the correct answer.

Repeat steps 2-4 for a set of questions.

Finally, display the total score.

You’ve used a questions list, but I don’t see its definition here. Make sure you’ve defined your questions and their corresponding options elsewhere in your code.

Similarly, the answers list isn’t provided here. You’ll need to define the correct answers for each question.

The code assumes that the user’s input will be either ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, or ‘D’. You might want to add some error handling to handle other inputs gracefully.

There’s a typo in your incorrect answer message: “INCORRRECT!” should be “INCORRECT!” (with just one ‘R’).
