1.Setting Up the Environment:

The from turtle import * line imports the turtle module, which provides a way to create graphics using a virtual “turtle.”

The title('CoderHuBhai') sets the title of the turtle graphics window.

The bgcolor("black") sets the background color to black.

The speed(4) sets the drawing speed (4 is moderate).

2.Drawing the Turtle Art:

The code defines a function called CoderHu(x, y) that moves the turtle cursor to the specified coordinates (x, y).

The turtle then draws various shapes, including the trunk, eyes, tilak, crown, legs, and hands.

Each shape is drawn using a combination of circle, forward, left, and other turtle commands.

Colors are set using pencolor and fillcolor.

The begin_fill() and end_fill() commands are used to fill shapes with color.

3.Creating Symmetry:

The left and right ears, legs, and hands are drawn symmetrically.

4.Finishing Touches:

The turtle’s position is reset to the center using home().

The screen is cleared using clearscreen().

5.Hiding the Turtle Cursor:

The hideturtle() command hides the turtle cursor.

The done() command keeps the drawing window open until the user closes it.
