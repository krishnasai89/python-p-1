# Email Slicer

- Your username: That’s the part before the “@” symbol.

- The domain: That’s everything after the “@” symbol, including the domain name (like “gmail.com” or “outlook.com”).

*So, if you entered an email like “example123@example.com,” your username would be “example123,” and the domain would be “@example.com.”*
